This project is a simple University Course Registration System that helps manage students, courses, and registration requests in an organized way. It uses different data structures: a linked list to store students and their courses, a binary search tree (BST) to store and search courses quickly, a queue to process registration requests in order, and a stack to undo the last action. The system allows adding students, adding courses, registering students for multiple courses, undoing the last registration, and displaying all students with their registered courses. It runs in the terminal with a menu-based interface and provides basic but efficient operations for small to medium data.
